# Cluster Computing

This page documents the usage of the contact detection on [SLURM] based clusters.

Examples using the cluster at the [Digital Alliance](https://www.alliancecan.ca/en) are provided [here](https://github.com/NanoscopyAI/tutorial_mcs_detect)

Cluster specific scripts can also be found [here](https://github.com/bencardoen/SubPrecisionContactDetection.jl/tree/main/hpcscripts)
