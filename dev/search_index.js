For example, say you have a mitochondrial vesicle at Z-slice 5.  Bleedthrough can lead to intensity mimicking a faint object at Z-slice 8. The Z-filter removes this by filtering the intensity distribution, per channel. If you set Z=1, all intensity below mu + 1 * sigma is set to zero.","category":"page"},{"location":"parameters/#Guidance","page":"Parameter selection","title":"Guidance","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"parameters/","page":"Parameter selection","title":"Parameter selection","text":"A z-value is that is too high will cause false negatives because you're removing intensity from the organelles, not the background. A too low value will included possible contacts between organelles and phantom intensity, e.g. false positives. A value of z=3 is used for the paper, derived from the size of the cell and the anisotropy.  Recommended usage is to test Z-values on a single representative cell, and plot the organelle volume, in combination with visual inspection.  Instructions on how to do this and accompanying scripts can be found here.","category":"page"},{"location":"parameters/#Window-size-(w)","page":"Parameter selection","title":"Window size (w)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"parameters/#Concept-2","page":"Parameter selection","title":"Concept","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"parameters/","page":"Parameter selection","title":"Parameter selection","text":"Correlation requires a comparison between two vectors of data, in 2- or 3D images this means a window size.

A too small value will fail to capture large patterns.  So what, then is 'too' small or large? At a minimum, the window should cover the width of the contact, but no more than 2.5x.  The interested reader will detect similarities with how resolution and pixel-dimensions relate. I will give an example to give a more actionable insight: Let us assume pixel precision is 50nm in X, Y, and 75nm in Z. Say the expected contacts you wish to capture are 0-25nm.  In this case w=1 would be sufficient, because a window of 3x3x3 would span 150nm lateral, and 225nm axial.  W=2 would mean 250nm lateral and 375nm axial, which is likely too large, it would be dominated by differentials that are unrelated to the contact.
