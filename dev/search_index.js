The interested reader will detect similarities with how resolution and pixel-dimensions relate. I will give an example to give a more actionable insight: Let us assume pixel precision is 50nm in X, Y, and 75nm in Z. Say the expected contacts you wish to capture are 0-25nm.  In this case w=1 would be sufficient, because a window of 3x3x3 would span 150nm lateral, and 225nm axial.  W=2 would mean 250nm lateral and 375nm axial, which is likely too large, it would be dominated by differentials that are unrelated to the contact.

For example, stability can be with respect to parameters or noise. Stability matters for validation because you do not want to publish results that only exist for alpha=0003 and w=2, and no other values. Ideally on representative (median) cells, you do a parameter sweep to show a consistent difference or a consistent recall/precision with respect to ground truth.","category":"page"},{"location":"validation/","page":"Validation and Limitations","title":"Validation and Limitations","text":"note: Stability\nWe made the simplification of using addition here, that is rarely true, but the principle holds. In addition, you do not want the stability to be small, but predictable. For example, as epsilon increases, how does delta increase?
